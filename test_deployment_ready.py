Popular late-night options near us: Pho Thin (authentic pho, open until 11 PM), street food vendors on Ta Hien (open until midnight), or 24-hour convenience stores with instant noodles. Would you like me to help you download the Grab app or provide our WhatsApp for assistance when you arrive?"

As a vegetarian, you'll love these nearby options: 1) **Zenith Yoga Cafe** (2 mins walk) - excellent vegetarian pho and fresh spring rolls, 2) **Minh Chay** (5 mins walk) - authentic Buddhist vegetarian cuisine, fake meat that tastes amazing, 3) **Govinda Restaurant** (8 mins walk) - Indian vegetarian with great dal and naan. For street food, try **vegetarian banh mi** from vendors (ask for 'banh mi chay'). Most pho places can make vegetarian broth on request. Would you like specific addresses or help with Vietnamese phrases to order vegetarian food?"

Tips for your airport transfer: 1) **Book through reception** - we guarantee the price and driver reliability, 2) **Grab taxi** - usually 250,000-300,000 VND depending on traffic, 3) **Airport bus** - cheapest option at 30,000 VND, leaves every 15 minutes. Travel time: 45-60 minutes depending on traffic. Need help booking? I can arrange pickup time based on your flight.
