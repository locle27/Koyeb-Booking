### 📊 Simple RAG vs 🧠 Gemini RAG Examples:

**Query: "I'm arriving late and hungry, what should I do?"**

**Simple RAG Response:**
```
Check-in time is 14:00 (2 PM). Early check-in is subject to availability. 
Must try: Pho, Bun Cha, Banh Mi. Hanoi Old Quarter offers diverse dining options.
```

**Gemini RAG Response:**
```
Since you're arriving late and hungry, here's what I recommend:

1) Our reception is available 24/7 for late check-in - no problem!
2) For immediate food, I suggest ordering from Grab Food or Baemin (both deliver 24/7)
3) Popular late-night options near us:
   - Pho Thin (authentic pho, open until 11 PM)
   - Ta Hien street food vendors (open until midnight)
   - 24-hour convenience stores with instant noodles

Would you like me to help you download the Grab app or provide our WhatsApp 
for assistance when you arrive?
